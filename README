What George Washington did for us was to throw out the British, so
that we wouldn't have a fat, insensitive government running our
country. Nice try anyway, George.

There is a limit to the admiration we may hold for a man who spends
his waking hours poking the contents of chickens with a stick.

Support your local police force -- steal!!
Despising machines to a man,
The Luddites joined up with the Klan,
	And ride out by night
	In a sheeting of white
To lynch all the robots they can.
